We have introduced a novel approach called **Deformable Large Kernel Attention (D-LKA Attention)** to enhance medical image segmentation. This method efficiently captures volumetric context using large convolution kernels, avoiding excessive computational demands. D-LKA Attention also benefits from deformable convolutions to adapt to diverse data patterns. We've created both 2D and 3D versions, with the 3D version excelling in cross-depth data understanding. This forms the basis of our new hierarchical Vision Transformer architecture, the *D-LKA Net*, which outperforms existing methods on popular medical segmentation datasets (Synapse, NIH Pancreas, and Skin lesion).

## Results
### 2D Synapse Dataset
State-of-the-art comparison on the abdominal multi-organ Synapse dataset for 2D methods. The model complexity and performance (DSC, HD95) are shown for all models. The proposed 2D D-LKA Net achieves superior segmentation performance. Abbreviations stand for: Spl: _spleen_, RKid: _right kidney_, LKid: _left kidney_, Gal: _gallbladder_, Liv: _liver_, Sto: _stomach_, Aor: _aorta_, Pan: _pancreas_. Best results are shown in <h style="color:blue;">blue</h>, second best in <h style="color:red;">red</h>.

### 3D Synapse Dataset
State-of-the-art comparison on the abdominal multi-organ Synapse dataset for 3D methods. The model complexity and performance (DSC, HD95) are shown for all models. The proposed 3D D-LKA Net achieves superior segmentation performance. Our model also is considerably small with the lowest number of parameters. Abbreviations stand for: Spl: _spleen_, RKid: _right kidney_, LKid: _left kidney_, Gal: _gallbladder_, Liv: _liver_, Sto: _stomach_, Aor: _aorta_, Pan: _pancreas_. Best results are shown in <h style="color:blue;">blue</h>, second best in <h style="color:red;">red</h>.

### Qualitative Results
While the 2D version achieves great segmentation results in comparison to other 2D models, the main limitation is the lack of inter-slice connections. Here, the 3D models achieve favorable segmentations.
